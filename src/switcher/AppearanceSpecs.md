# Appearance (window sizing) — Specs

> **Line coverage:** `AppearanceTestable.swift` 79% · _refreshed 2026-05-27 by `/coverage-explore`_

## Summary

Two pure sizing functions in `AppearanceTestable` decide how big the switcher's thumbnails are on a
given display, so the UI feels right from an 11" laptop to a 60" TV. The suite pins their output against
a table of **21 real device models** (laptops, monitors, ultrawides, TVs) with known pixel + physical
dimensions, so a tweak to the formula can't silently regress any class of screen.

- `comfortableWidth(physicalDimension)` → the fraction of the screen the switcher should occupy (smaller
  fraction on bigger/wider screens, separate expectations for horizontal vs vertical use).
- `goodValuesForThumbnailsWidthMinMax(ratio, rowCount)` → the (min, max) thumbnail width for a given
  screen aspect ratio and row count (3, 4, or 5 rows).

## Behavior & edge cases

- Driven entirely by a fixture table: each row is `(model, pixels, physical-mm, expected comfortable
  fractions, [(rowCount, expectedMin, expectedMax)])`. Both tests loop the table and assert with `0.01`
  tolerance, naming the failing model.
- Bigger physical screens get a smaller comfortable fraction (a 60" TV shouldn't show a half-screen
  switcher); ultrawides get distinct horizontal vs vertical fractions.

## Test scenarios

Mirrors `AppearanceTests.swift` 1:1.

- **testGoodValuesForThumbnailsWidthMinMax** — for every model × {3,4,5} rows, the computed (min, max) thumbnail width matches the fixture.
- **testComfortableWidth** — for every model, the comfortable width fraction matches for both horizontal and vertical screen use.
- **testComfortableWidthFallsBackToDefaultWhenPhysicalWidthIsNil** — when the screen's physical dimensions aren't reported, fall back to the 0.9 default rather than the 0.45 floor.
- **testGoodValuesForThumbnailsWidthMinMaxPortrait** — for aspectRatio < 1 (portrait usage), the (min, max) uses the portrait formula and stays within the [0.09, 0.30] clamps.

## Selected-window preview corners on macOS 27

The selected-window preview outline follows the native preview panel's effective
container-concentric radius. It uses a continuous layer border and refreshes when
the effective radius or appearance changes. Earlier macOS versions retain the
existing drawn outline. This does not infer an arbitrary source window's silhouette.

Manual regression scenarios:
- On macOS 27, summon with selected-window preview enabled and cycle among normal
  windows. Check that the outer outline follows the preview panel without square
  protrusions and updates after resizing or changing appearance.
- Check fullscreen and custom-shaped source windows, different displays and
  scale factors, and light/dark appearance. These require visual validation.
- On macOS 26 or earlier, compare against an unpatched build to verify unchanged
  outline rendering. Native corner configuration is unavailable on those systems.

The original local candidate was visually checked with Device Hub on macOS 27.
That observation does not establish the broader scenarios above.
