## Mac development ecosystem

Mac development ecosystem is pretty terrible in general. They keep piling on the tech stacks on top of each other, so you have C APIs, ObjC APIs, Swift APIs, Interface builder, Playgrounds, Swift UI. All these are bridging each other with a bunch of macros, SDKs glue, compiler flags, compatibility mode, XCode legacy build system, etc. So keep that in mind. For alt-tab, we are on Swift 4.2. Note that swift just recently started being stable, but overall any change of version breaks a lot of stuff. Swift itself is the worst governed language project I’ve seen in modern times.

Regarding SDKs, it’s very different from other (better) ecosystems like Java. Here the SDK is bundled with XCode, and XCode is bundled with the OS. This means that from a machine running let’s say macOS 10.10, you have access to only a specific range of XCode versions (you can’t run the latest for instance), and these give you access to a specific range of SDKs (i.e. Swift + objc + c + bridges + compiler + toolchain + etc)

Documentation is abysmal. Very simple things are not documented at all, and good information is hard to find. Compared to other ecosystem I’ve worked on in the past like Android, nodejs, Java, rust, this is really a bad spot. You can truly tell Apple doesn’t care about supporting third-parties. They are in such a good position that people will struggle and just push through to deliver on their ecosystem because it is so valuable, and because they don’t have to care, they don’t. They could pay an intern to update the docs over the summer for instance, just to give you context of the lack of care we are talking about here.

Dependencies were historically never handled by Apple. The community came up with [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/) which is the de-facto dependency manager for Apple ecosystem projects these days, even though Apple is now trying to push their own.

OS APIs are quite limited for the kind of low-level, system-wide app alt-tab is. This means often we just don’t have an API to do something. For instance, there is no API to ask the OS “how many Spaces does the user have?” or “Can you focus the window on Space 2?”. There are however, retro-engineered private APIs which you can call. These are not documented at all, not guaranteed to be there in future macOS releases, and prevent us from releasing alt-tab on the Mac AppStore. We have tried my best to [document](src/api-wrappers/PrivateApis.swift) the ones we are using, as well as ones we investigated in the past.

## This project specifically

To mitigate the issues listed above, we took some measures.

We minimize reliance on XCode, InterfaceBuilder, Playground, and other GUI tools. You can’t cut the dependency completely though as only XCode can build macos apps. Currently the project has these files:

* 1 xib (InterfaceBuilder UI file, describing the menubar items like “Edit” or “Format”)
* `alt-tab-macos.xcodeproj` file describing alt-tab itself. It contains some settings for the app
* `alt-tab-macos.xcworkspace` file describing an xcode workspace containing alt-tab + cocoapods dependencies. You open that file to open the project in XCode or AppCode
* `Alt-tab-macos.entitlements` and Info.plist which are static files describing some app config for XCode
* `PodFile` and `PodFile.lock` describe dependencies on open-source libraries (e.g. [Sparkle](https://github.com/sparkle-project/Sparkle))
* Some `.xcconfig` files in `config/` which contain XCode settings that people typically change using XCode UI, but that I want to be version controlled

We use the command line to build the project, not XCode GUI. See how to build in the [README.md](README.md).

The project directory is organized in the following way:

| Path | Role |
|------|-------|
| `config/` | XCode build settings                              |
| `docs/`   | supporting material to document the project       |
| `resources/` | files that are shipped inside the final `.app` (e.g. icons) |
| `scripts/` | bash scripts useful for CI and local workflows |
| `src/`     | Swift source code |
| `src/api-wrappers` | Wrapping some unfriendly APIs (usually C-APIs) |
| `src/logic`        | Business logic (i.e. "models") |
| `src/ui`           | UI code (e.g. sublasses of NSView or NSCollectionView) |

Other folders/files are either tooling or auto-generated (e.g. `Pods/` and `Frameworks/` are generated by `pod install`)
