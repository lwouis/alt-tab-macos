**alt-tab-macos** brings the power of Windows' "alt-tab" window switcher to macOS.

## Installation

[**Download the latest release**](https://github.com/lwouis/alt-tab-macos/releases/latest)
and extract it in your Applications folder. If macOS refuses to run the application
because it's from an unidentified developer, right-click the application,
choose **Open** then click **Open** in the prompt that appears.

## Compatibility

* Hold `⌥ option` and press `⇥ tab` to select the next thumbnail.
* Hold `⌥ option` and press `⇧ shift` + `⇥ tab` to select the previous thumbnail.
* Release `⌥ option` to switch focus to the window.

**Extra:**

* You hover and click with the `🖱️ mouse`.
* You cycle with `⇦ left arrow` and `⇨ right arrow`.
* You can cancel with `⎋ escape`.

## Configuration

* Change the shortcut key, switch to a Windows theme and more, using the Preferences window.
* If you like scriptable/portable configuration, you can edit `~/Library/Preferences/alt-tab-macos.json`.

## Alternatives

Before building my own app, I looked around at similar apps. However, none was completely satisfactory so I rolled my own. Also, the almost-good-enough apps are not open-source.
