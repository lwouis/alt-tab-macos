# Alternatives

Before building my own app, I looked around at similar apps. However, none was completely satisfactory so I rolled my own. Also the almost-good-enough apps are not open-source.

|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [HyperSwitch](https://bahoom.com/hyperswitch) and [HyperDock](https://bahoom.com/hyperdock) | Closed-source. Thumbnails are too small. App icon is on top of the thumbnail                        |
| [Witch](https://manytricks.com/witch/) and [Context](https://contexts.co/)                  | 10-15$. Closed-source. Focus on text. No thumbnails                                                                         |
| [Switch](https://github.com/numist/Switch)  | Open Source. Some complains mapping ‚åòtab. Works fine with option-tab |
| Built-in [MissionControl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_Control_\(macOS\))          | No keyboard support                                                                                          |
| `‚åò command` + `‚á• tab`                                                                     | Only shows apps, not windows (note: can press down to see window of selected app)                            |
| `‚åò command` + `` ` ``                                                                      | Cycles through tabs and windows, but only of the same app. Only cycling, no direct access                    |
